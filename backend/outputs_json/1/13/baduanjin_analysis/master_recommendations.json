  "overall": "The Baduanjin sequence demonstrates excellent balance, symmetry, and controlled movements throughout all eight forms. Pay special attention to the fluidity between transitions and maintaining proper alignment.",
  "keyPoints": [
    "Maintain vertical alignment during 'Holding Up The Sky'",
    "Keep shoulders relaxed during 'Drawing The Bow'",
    "Distribute weight evenly between feet during 'Separating Heaven and Earth'",
    "Use controlled rotation during 'Looking Backward' to avoid jerky movements",
    "Keep stable base during 'Swinging Head and Tail'",
    "Use gradual weight shifts during 'Bouncing on Toes'"
  ],
  "jointAngles": "Focus on achieving optimal hip and knee angles during transitions. Maintain 90-degree elbow angles during Drawing The Bow and do not exceed 130-degree shoulder elevation.",
  "smoothness": "All movements should be performed with consistent, controlled speed. Avoid rapid acceleration or deceleration, especially during transitions between forms.",
  "symmetry": "Left and right sides should perform identical movements with equal range of motion. Pay special attention to shoulder and hip symmetry during rotational movements.",
  "balance": "Center of mass should remain stable throughout the sequence, with controlled weight shifts. Maintain stable base of support during single-leg movements."
